** DONE Converting Resistivity in to P-Doping concentration for Silicon
** DONE Work out way of reading both Excel data sheets (OpenPyXL)
** DONE Plot and display both graphs of delta n against tau (matplotlib or pyx)

** DONE Fix doping text cut off on window open
** DONE Fix Iron concentration calculations should all be above 1E10

* Critical
** TODO Add ability to set C value for normal iron plot
** TODO Add warning if fitting results in worse plot
** TODO Make fits from SRH theory to QSSPC lifetime plots
** TODO Change limit for drawing interpolation lines as doesn't work with old files
** TODO Fix status bar in exectuable - is this status bar or matplotlib canvas?
** TODO Get C factor for every point in iron map calculation by looking at QSSPC fits backwards to get the injection level from the lifetime
** TODO Print warning if injection level difference is high between the lifetimes for the same point at many ponits
** TODO When value is too high just take highest value 
** TODO When value is too low just take lowest value as there is very little variation on the right of the COP
** TODO Make this another option for plotting the iron map
** TODO Out put 4 averages for iron concentration: QSSPC reading at the deltan from the given injection level, mean from last values of QSSPC reading (already printed), mean value from PL map with constant C factor (current) and mean value from varying C factor PL map (new)
** TODO Allow editing of entered gen level from main window
** TODO Reduce compiled size (below 20MB ideally)
** TODO Make standalone executable
** TODO Find units for prefactor
** TODO Add warning if it appears that before and after file are swapped for excel too
** TODO Remove 1000x1000 arbitrary scale, instead read size of array
** TODO Add proper error handling to file saving - use try except in case file is in use etc.
* Necessary
** TODO Add ticks to colorbars to remove rare values shown
** TODO Fix numbify bugs for filled text boxes - or add error handling - could maybe do this by storing previous string and comparing
** TODO Add specific error messages
** TODO Try to enable keyboard navigation somehow
** TODO Try to add more Mouse based UI
** TODO Make save dialogs defaultly have .png there
** TODO Add temperature dependence and see how it changes estimate for COP
** TODO ADd plot to zoom by mouse - use pylab instead
** TODO Add documentation
** TODO Comment and cleanup code - i.e. make signals standardised
** TODO In save dialog ask to append PNG extension if none given
** TODO Also ask if extension is other than PNG
** TODO Could provide options for other filetypes too
** TODO Add error handling for file saving
** TODO Add way of finding Crossover point and centering view on it
** TODO Maybe add figure clearing to early plots although not broken
** TODO Make it so resistivty etc. is laoded with before file
** TODO Make save function combine both plots and save them
** TODO Add zooming rescale colors for PL images
** TODO Make Resistivity editable
** TODO Enable saving of C factor data
* Optional
** TODO With tabbed window allow way of selecting certain columns to save data
** TODO Add menu bar - ability to load excel files and save plots
** TODO Maybe add functioning status bar
** TODO Make it so hovering voer graph shows values in status bar
** TODO Make CLI versions for mass scripting and saving of data
* Manual
** TODO Screnshots
** TODO QSSPC measurements
** TODO PL Imaging
** TODO Editing constants
* Image Matching
** transformation_berechnen(I, T, maxdelta=34, korrelationsgroesse=128, N=5)
** returns list trafo: dx, dy, alpha, scale

** T_T is transformed array, must first be created
